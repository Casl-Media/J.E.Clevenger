			    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">On the current state of society relative to the title of this page:</p>
                <p>As Sir Isaac Newton <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">might have phrased it</a>, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."</p>
                <p>I think all advances are made by giants, but that each individual could help push the boundaries; we all have some sort of magnitude. I think it's disappointing we aren't all doing ballet on the peaks.</p>

                <p style="padding-top: 1em;">On quantitative and qualitative results of computational analysis:</p>
                <p>Realtive to experiments: You can't know every variable in reality, you have to know every variable to perform computation.</p>
                <p>It's likely you can't know every variable you'd like to know to validate your experiment. In making assumptions you can get close and focus on evaluating small error. Concluding a casuse-and-effect chain to explain the error can be difficult to achieve, relative to other worldly things. 100% validation and reductionism is desired but rarely achieved and never communicated broadly. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences</a> is on display when classical equations can predict the outcome of solid and fluid mechanic experiments within 5% (easily) via computation. A more complete explanation of where different paradigms of science are validated and where they break down is required in the education system.</p>
