			    <p>I've been told listening, reading, and writing are three methods of learning the same material.</p>
			    <p>This seems to be true on some level. An alternate truth may be if you work with a subject, or topic, enough to learn it you'll by default pass the material through these mediums. </p>
			    <p>The action of passing material through these different methods is what seems to be the important. The act of the individual making an effort to pass their interpretation of the subject through these communication mediums.</p>
			    <p>It requires the individual to make something concrete, concrete in terms of the rules the medium imposes. Passing from the abstract thought, which the individual can only know in their personal consciousness, to a medium which will attempt capture an analogue of the abstract thought. </p>
			    <p>Once a snapshot of thought is captured via the medium it is removed from the individual. It is free for interpretation by other individuals. Interpretation is subject to each individual's personal consciousness.</p>
			    <p>If the medium is language (verbal or written), interpretation is constrained by the time-dependent framework of the language. This is truly the power of language, providing a means of clarity when trading concepts between individuals.</p>
			    <p>Having this view of language one can see the beauty in writing. The act of communicating one's abstract thoughts is a necessary exercise. Writing continues to push the abstract thoughts forward. Abstract thought is a time-dependent process, capturing snapshots of this process in language allows logic to act on the abstract thought. Logic provides a means of both criticism and confirmation. </p>
