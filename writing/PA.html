                <p>Personal advertisement is a topic I need to address given the function of this domain.</p>
                <p>I don't believe self-praise, i.e. gloating, boasting, bragging, etc, is a desirable attribute in a person. I have my personal reasons for this belief, also known as opinions, which aren't worth writing about. </p>
                <p>You can see thought provoking examples in anthropology. In certain hunter-gatherer societies after a successful hunt the accomplished hunter will share the spoils and not return for the next hunt. Interpretation of <i>why</i> the hunter will not return is left open. One possibility is they are allowing others from the society to contribute and receive the praise for doing so. I've seen these studies discussed multiple times but the current example I'm paraphrasing is from an Edward Wilson book (I think, I need to get my sources in-line). </p>
                <p>The bigger take-away from the above thought experiment is the discussion of what attributes could be positive or negative for a society. The questions that follow are <i>why</i>, <i>on what scale</i>, and <i>in what way</i>. I don't think self-praise is a positive attribute. I do think self-advertisement has a useful place.</p>
                <p>In todays society there are more and more people, particularly more and more skilled or educated people. In engineering it is still resume based hiring from my experience (which includes interviews, which lend much more information than a resume). In the programming world it's often portfolio based (I assume there are interviews as well). I think the latter is better than the former, even if they are analogues.</p>
                <p>Resume based or portfolio based the function is the same, hiring. Looking for a fit in a group which has  the goal of getting some target work accomplished. I think personal advertisement should be expanded beyond the portfolio to offer the goals of the individual, current work, etc; an active snapshot of the individual.</p>
                <p>As groups are able to accomplish more and more with fewer and fewer people the key becomes finding the right people, I think personal advertisement can expedite this process. How people do work and why they choose to do certain work will continue to evolve. I think certain ethics, or principals, can be carried through an individual's career and personal advertisement can help to display these roots. </p>
                <p>Seeing an individual's body of work can aid others seeking help for specific problems. If the problem is an old one, with well documented previous attempts, self advertisement can make clear an individual's approach to the problem.</p>
                <p>This relates to <i>The Importance of Collaboration</i> which I will write soon. The gist of it is I need collaboration to keep my ideas moving forward, I think as humans this is true for everyone. The question is in what fashion and scale. The magic solo inventor genius in the closet doesn't exist (this relates to <i>The Subjective Experience</i> which I might write soon).</p>
                <p>This also relates to <i>The Connected Age</i> which I will write later. The gist of it is the connected age, which is enabled by modern Internet usage, lends itself to self-praise and this is a problem for multiple reasons. </p>

                <p>The function of my writing lab relative to “blogging”.</p>
                <p>In my mind there is a clear difference between what I am trying to deliver and what is typically contained in a blog. While there are plenty of similarities in the delivery method, the content should be the point of focus. Here there are significant differences.</p>
                <p>Blogs typically focus on the author's opinions. While my the fabric of my thoughts are interwoven with my subjective opinions, the goal is to delivery a purpose built quilt. </p>
                <p>My least favorite part of reading non-fiction books is when the author focuses the writing on their personal involvement, experience, or opinion when it isn't directly needed in the discussion of the content.</p>
                <p>The best examples of this are found in “new introductions” tacked onto old classics. The new introduction always involves some author of current fame talking about their relation to the content. Subliminally suggesting because they have some relation to it the content is further validated. This may serve some useful function, i.e. bridging the content to a new era,  but there should be a minimized delivery method solely focused on the content. Cut off the fat.</p>
                <p>Chasing the concise might sacrifice other qualities. Those qualities can be chased in different modes of delivery. There should be multiple methods of content delivery for the same topic, this is already the world we know. Think about all the sources you can find via a search engine for the definition of a word, or learning resources for a specific topic. </p>
