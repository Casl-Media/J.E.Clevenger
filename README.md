D3 timeline implementation
</li>
<li>
D3/jQuery for timeline information navigation 
</li>

</li>

</li>
<li>
jQuery publishing text data based on json format
</li>
<li>
really just jquery overall, D3 for some data visualization, had to decide on a data format that made sense for navigation given the data scrubbing methods I used. Should be pretty easy to just swap data and start playing with your own timeline, i might make it separate repo.
